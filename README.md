# 📝 Dev Notes  

A collection of **development notes, tips, snippets, and quick-start references** that I’ve gathered while working with different technologies.  
The goal is simple: create a **go-to space for developers** (including future me 😅) to quickly pick up concepts and best practices without getting stuck in the weeds.
