1. Full Fine-Tuning

* Retrains all model weights.
* Extremely resource-intensive (multi-A100s, many hours/days).
* Rarely needed unless your dataset is huge (hundreds of thousands of images).

2. DreamBooth (personalization)

* Teaches the model a new concept (e.g., your dog, a product) with a small dataset (10–100 images).
* Fine-tunes just enough weights so you can invoke that concept with a trigger word in prompts.
* Works well if your dataset is centered around a subject.

3. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)

* Much lighter—trains small adapters instead of the full model.
* Great if you want to adapt SDXL to your dataset without huge compute costs.
* You can combine multiple LoRA adapters later (flexible).
